# Diffusion Models Assignment

This repository contains implementations for unconditional and conditional diffusion models (DDPM) on MNIST, as per the assignment instructions.

## Structure

- `part_a/` — Unconditional DDPM code, theory summary, experiments
- `part_b/` — Conditional DDPM code, conditioning notes
- `results/` — Loss curves and generated sample images
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `report.pdf` — Final report (to be added)

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run Part A (unconditional):
   ```bash
   python part_a/diffusion_uncond.py
   ```
3. Run Part B (conditional):
   ```bash
   python part_b/diffusion_conditional.py
   ```

Generated results will be saved in the `results/` folder.
